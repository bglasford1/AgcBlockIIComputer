PowerUp:  To power up from standby, perform the following:
- Hit RESET button --> This moves state to PWRON.
- Hit F13 button --> This moves state to TP1.
- Hit CLK: STEP button --> This starts running the clock.  The states run to the next instruction or subsequence.
- Toggle between EXEC: INST/SEQ to step to next instruction or next seq.
- Toggle between CLK: RUN/STEP to free run or step the clock.
- Toggle back to CLK: STEP to step the clock.

Menu:
  Control:
    - Load: Input a file name (not extension) such as "agc" to load a program.
    - Quit: Quit the program.
  Debugger:
    - Set Breakpoint: Set a breakpoint at a given address.  Halt execution at that address.  See below...
    - Clear Breakpoint: Clear the breakpoint set previously.
    - Interupt Breakpoint: Sets a breakpoint that stops execution when an interrupt occurs.
    - Display Details: A check box that turns on/off the printing of timing pulses.
    - Examine: Examine an address of memory in FF,AAAA format.  Ex: 05,2526
    - Show Source: Show the currently executing line of code along with 10 lines above and below this line.

Set Breakpoint:
- Enter a breakpoint in terms of an F-Bank,address as in the assembler listing (ex. 05,2526)
- Toggle to FLCK to free run the clock.
- Toggle to RUN INST to free run the TPG state machine.
- When the address is reached, the clock will stop free-running.  The toggle switch will not switch.
- Currently it stops at TP12.  Toggle MCLK/FCLK to FCLK to quickly go to end of this instruction.
- NOTE: When the simulation stops, the FCLK/MCLK and RUN/STEP INST buttons are out of sync and should be
        manually toggled.

Control Panel:
- (F2) CLK: RUN/STEP: Toggle the FCLK control signal.  Enables/Disables free-running 1 MHz clock.
- (F1) STEP CLOCK: Single step the clock.  Only works if CLK: STEP is set.
- SCALER: Toggle scaler on/off.  When scaler is off, F13 and F17 signals are not automatically generated.
- (a) STBY ALLOW: Let the AGC software put the AGC in standby mode.
- (r) EXEC: RUN/STEP: Toggles between run and step modes.  Either free-run or step the instruction.
- (s) STEP: Step the instruction or sequence if RUN/STEP is set to STEP.
- (n) EXEC: INST/SEQ: Toggle between instruction or subsequence steps.  Each subsequence is 12 timing pulses long.
- (i) INTERRUPT: Generate an interrupt.  Will ask for an interrupt number.
- (;) CLR PARALM: Clear parity alarm.  Alarm is generated when an error occurs in memory.
- (x) F13: Manually generate an F13 scaler pulse.
- (z) F17: Manually generate an F17 scaler pulse.
- (h) RESET: Reset the simulation.
- ([) INC CTR: Manually insert a + input to a priority counter cell.  Will ask for the cell number.
- (]) DEC CTR: Manually insert a - input to a priority counter cell.  Will ask for the cell number.
