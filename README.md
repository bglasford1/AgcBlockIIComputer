# AgcBlockIIComputer
A software/hardware implementation of the Apollo Guidance Computer Block II computer using TTL chips.

This project extends the work of Ronald Burkey who has created an extensive collection of NASA documents, original source code, 
an assembler and a software based simulator.  This project also extends the work of John Pultorak who created a physical build 
of the AGC Block I using TTL chips.  There are other AGC Block II projects using either VHDL or 3-input XOR chips.  As far I as 
I can tell, this is the only project to implement an AGC Block II using TTL chips.

The overall steps include 
    1) understanding the overall design of the AGC, 
    2) building a hardware based software simulator, 
    3) creating hardware diagrams and
    4) building the actual hardware.
    
The overall design is contained in the Wiki pages.  The software simulator and hardware diagrams are contained within the code
section.
